# Programming Assignment 1
### Virginia State University Computer Science
## CSCI445/545 Computer Communication Network / Advanced Data Communications 

Using any programming language of your choice, implement a program that converts the content in a file to the appropriate form to be placed in the body of the BISYNC protocol, and saved the output to an output file. Your program must meet the following requirement, 

### BISYNC
![BISYNC](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200805161103/bisync11.png)

-	Read a file whose content is the data to be transmitted using the BISYNC protocol.
-	Write to a file that contains the data that is in the appropriate form that is readily to be placed in the body of the BISYNC protocol.
-	The hexadecimal values of DLE, STX, and ETX are, 

  |SPECIAL CHARACTER | HEXADECIMAL |
  |------------------|-------------|
  | STX              | 0x02        |
  | ETX	             | 0x03        |
  | DLE	             | 0x10        |
  
-	Provide sufficient test cases (minimally one). 


### Submission:
Submit your code through Github Classroom by 11:59PM, September 13, 2020. 
In your submission, include source code files, inputs of your test cases, outputs of test cases, and clearly indicate which input corresponding to which output.
